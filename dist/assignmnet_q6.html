        writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parent's garage in 1976,
        was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in 1997,
        and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into the world's
        most valuable company. Along the way he helped to transform seven
        industries: personal computing, animated movies, music phones, tablet
        computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the
        pantheo of America's great innovators, along with the Thomas Edison,
        Henry Fored, and Walt Disney. None of these men was a saint, but long
        their personalities are forgotten, history will remember how they
        applied imagination to technology and business.

          Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February
          24, 1955, to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah "John" Jandali.
          Jandali was born in a Muslim household to wealthy Syrian parents, the
          youngest of nine siblings. After obtaining his undergraduate degree at
          the American University of Beirut, Jandali pursued a PhD in political
          science at the University of Wisconsin. There, he met Joanne Schieble,
          an American Catholic of German descent whose parents owned a mink farm
          and real estate. The two fell in love but faced opposition from
          Schieble's father due to Jandali's Muslim faith. When Schieble became
          pregnant, she arranged for a closed adoption, and travelled to San
          Francisco to give birth. Schieble requested that her son be adopted by
          college graduates. A lawyer and his wife were selected, but they
          withdrew after discovering that the baby was a boy, so Jobs was
          instead adopted by Paul Reinhold and Clara Jobs. Paul Jobs was the son
          of a dairy farmer; after dropping out of high school, he worked as a
          mechanic, then joined the U.S. Coast Guard. When his ship was
          decommissioned, he met Clara Hagopian, an American of Armenian
          descent, and the two were engaged ten days later, in March 1946, and
          married that same year. The couple moved to Wisconsin, then Indiana,
          where Paul Jobs worked as a machinist and later as a car salesman.
          Since Clara missed San Francisco, she convinced Paul to move back.
          There, Paul worked as a repossession agent, and Clara became a
          bookkeeper. In 1955, after having an ectopic pregnancy, the couple
          looked to adopt a child. Since they lacked a college education,
          Schieble initially refused to sign the adoption papers, and went to
          court to request that her son be removed from the Jobs household and
          placed with a different family, but changed her mind after Paul and
          Clara promised to pay for their son's college tuition.
